> "At the intersection of modular analysis, systemic cartography, and quantum ethics, we transcend dimensions of thought with methodological precision and unconditional love, integrating advanced tools for knowledge visualization and evolutionary preservation."

**EGOS** is a unique project aiming to create a highly integrated, modular, and ethically-grounded software ecosystem. **Inspired by blockchain principles of trust, transparency, immutability, and decentralized systems,** EGOS utilizes interconnected subsystems to achieve complex tasks with resilience, adaptability, and a core focus on ethical considerations defined by the **ETHIK** framework.

*(The initial phase and core AI assistant persona are sometimes referred to by the codename 'Eva Guarani').*

Refer to the full **[Master Quantum Prompt (MQP v9.0 "Full Moon Blueprint")](docs/MQP.md)** for the complete philosophical and operational blueprint.

**Development Approach Note:** This project utilizes a multi-agent AI collaboration model within the Cursor IDE, coordinated by an Orchestrator (Gemini 2.5 Pro) and supported by Task Executors (e.g., Quasar-Alpha). Key project documents (`ROADMAP.md`, `docs/website/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`, `docs/website/DESIGN_GUIDE.md`) and rules (`.cursor/rules/`) guide this process. See `docs/ai_collaboration/MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` for details.

The technical approach for the primary public-facing website involves a **Modern JavaScript Framework (Next.js/SvelteKit)** and a **Headless CMS**.

## ‚ú® Core Principles

EGOS development is guided by:

* **Universal Redemption & Unconditional Love:** Foundational ethical stance.
* **Sacred Privacy:** Protecting user data is paramount.
* **Integrated Ethics (ETHIK):** Ethics are woven into the system's fabric, not bolted on, **ensuring verifiable ethical actions and alignment.**
* **Conscious Modularity (NEXUS):** Building independent yet interconnected components, **enabling resilience and distributed operation akin to nodes in a network.**
* **Systemic Cartography (ATLAS):** Mapping and understanding system relationships for transparency.
* **Evolutionary Preservation (CRONOS):** Ensuring system history and state integrity, **providing an immutable-like record of system evolution.**
* **Context Continuity (CRONOS):** Maintaining context across interactions.
* **Harmonious Integration (HARMONY):** Ensuring components work together seamlessly, with a focus on Windows compatibility.
* **Standardization & Knowledge (KOIOS):** Enforcing standards for code, documentation, logging, and knowledge management, **crucial for system trust and verifiable operations.**

## ‚ú® Website & Dashboard Integration

The EGOS website (see `website/` directory) is built with Next.js and features:
- **Integrated Monitoring Dashboard:** Accessible at `/dashboard`, this page embeds the live EGOS Monitoring Dashboard via iframe, using the Streamlit Cloud deployment ([https://egosos.streamlit.app/](https://egosos.streamlit.app/)).
- **Interactive Roadmap:** The main page displays a modular, interactive roadmap. Contributors can click on tasks to open a detailed modal with contribution instructions, acceptance criteria, and direct links to relevant GitHub issues or code.
- **Contribution Flow:** Contributors are encouraged to use the website‚Äôs roadmap/modal as the primary way to discover, understand, and contribute to project tasks. Each modal provides links to GitHub for further discussion or code review.

Refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on the contribution workflow.

## ‚ú® Current Capabilities (via EGOS AI in Cursor)

The EGOS system, operated primarily through the **EGOS AI assistant (persona: EVA & GUARANI)** within Cursor IDE, currently focuses on:

*   **Codebase Understanding & Navigation (ATLAS):** Mapping dependencies and understanding the project structure to assist development.
*   **Modular Development & Refactoring (NEXUS):** Analyzing code modularity and suggesting improvements.
*   **Standard Enforcement (KOIOS):** Applying coding standards, managing documentation templates, ensuring consistent logging (including verifiable logging standards), and potentially validating data integrity.
*   **Ethical Guideline Application (ETHIK):** Incorporating privacy-preserving checks, policy enforcement, and ethical considerations during development discussions and code generation.
*   **Context & History Management (CRONOS):** Maintaining awareness of the development process and project evolution across interactions.
*   **Task Execution & Orchestration (CORUJA):** Performing development tasks, managing complex AI interactions, and applying basic monitoring/alignment principles based on user requests and project context.

Interaction with these capabilities occurs through natural language prompts directed at the **EGOS AI assistant** within the Cursor IDE chat or code context.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **IDE:** **[Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/)** (Essential for interacting with EVA & GUARANI)
*   **OS:** Windows (Primary development target)
*   **Python:** 3.9+
*   **Git:** For version control.
*   **PowerShell:** For running test/utility scripts.

### Development Environment Setup

Developing EGOS relies heavily on the **Cursor IDE** integrated with the **EGOS AI assistant (persona: EVA & GUARANI)**. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/enioxt/EVA-e-Guarani-EGOS.git # Replace with your fork if applicable
    cd EVA-e-Guarani-EGOS
    ```

2.  **Set up Python Environment:** Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies. This is standard Python practice.

    ```bash
    # Create virtual environment
    python -m venv .venv
    # Activate (Windows PowerShell)
    .venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Cursor IDE:** Crucially, follow the setup guide in **[cursor_initialization.md](.cursor/cursor_initialization.md)**. This ensures your terminal and environment context work correctly with the EGOS AI assistant.
4.  **Understand Cursor Rules:** Familiarize yourself with the files in **[.cursor/rules/](.cursor/rules/)**. These rules contain essential guidelines (like KOIOS standards, subsystem boundaries, etc.) that the **EGOS AI assistant** uses to assist with development, maintain consistency, and understand the project context. Interacting effectively often involves awareness of these rules.

### Configuration

*   While the core system doesn't require extensive manual configuration for *development within Cursor*, specific tasks delegated to the **EGOS AI assistant** might interact with subsystems requiring API keys or settings (e.g., `CORUJA` for external AI model access). These are typically managed via the `config/` directory and referenced in relevant subsystem documentation or Cursor Rules.
