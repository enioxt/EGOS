# üõ£Ô∏è MASTER Subsystem Roadmap (Placeholder)

**Version:** 0.1
**Last Updated:** [Current Date - Please Update Manually]

## Overview

The purpose and scope of the MASTER subsystem need clarification. It currently only contains documentation.

## Action Required

*   [ ] **Task META-MASTER-01:** Define the purpose of the MASTER subsystem. Is it a true subsystem, a documentation hub, or should its contents be merged elsewhere (e.g., root `docs/`)?

*(Based on the decision, this roadmap should be updated or the directory removed/refactored.)*
