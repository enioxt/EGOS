# HARMONY Subsystem

## Role in Dynamic Roadmap Sync & EGOS Interconnection

HARMONY is responsible for:
- Ensuring that all roadmap sync tools, scripts, and interconnection logic are fully compatible with Windows and other target platforms.
- Supporting cross-platform testing and validation for the dynamic roadmap sync process.
- Collaborating with KOIOS, MYCELIUM, and other subsystems to maintain seamless integration across environments.

Cross-reference: See ROADMAP.md sections "Dynamic Roadmap Sync & Mycelium Interconnection" and "Technical Implementation Plan: Dynamic Roadmap Sync (Phase 1)".
