**Version:** 0.1
**Last Updated:** [Current Date - Please Update Manually]

## Overview

This document outlines the planned development milestones for the TRANSLATOR subsystem, presumably responsible for language translation tasks.

## Current Phase (Aligned with EGOS Phase 2/3)

*   [ ] **Task TRANS-DEF-01:** Confirm scope (e.g., UI text, documentation, user input/output). Define core responsibilities.
*   [ ] **Task TRANS-API-01:** Design interface for translation requests.
*   [ ] **Task TRANS-IMPL-01:** Research and select translation service/library (e.g., Google Translate API, DeepL, local models).
*   [ ] **Task TRANS-CORE-01:** Implement core translation logic and error handling.
*   [ ] **Task TRANS-TEST-01:** Develop basic tests for translation functionality.

## Future Phases

*   Implement caching for common translations.
*   Explore context-aware translation.
*   Integrate with other subsystems requiring translation.

*(Please update with specific tasks, priorities, and timelines based on overall EGOS project plan.)*
