# üîó NEXUS Subsystem Roadmap

**Last Update:** April 5, 2025

This document outlines the detailed tasks and milestones specifically for the **NEXUS** subsystem (Modular Analysis & Optimization), complementing the high-level overview in the main project `../../ROADMAP.md`.

## üéØ Phase 2 Focus: Initial Structure Definition

### Initial Setup (Completed Tasks - Ref Main Roadmap Phase 2a)

*   Conceptual definition within MQP [DONE]

### Foundational Capabilities (Planned - Ref Main Roadmap Phase 2)

*   **Task NEX-STR-01: Define Core Analysis Concepts**
    *   **Relates to:** Main Roadmap Task `NEX-STR-01`
    *   **Goal:** Establish the initial concepts, abstractions, and potential analysis types for the NEXUS subsystem.
    *   **Sub-Tasks:**
        *   [ ] Define the concept of a "Nexus Unit" (e.g., a code file, a subsystem, a PDD, a document) that can be analyzed.
        *   [ ] Identify initial analysis types to potentially support (e.g., dependency analysis between code units, complexity metrics, PDD validation/linting, documentation linkage checks).
        *   [ ] Define the expected input/output formats for analysis tasks.
        *   [ ] Design a basic interface or pattern for analysis modules/plugins.
        *   [ ] Document these initial concepts in `subsystems/NEXUS/docs/concepts.md`.
    *   **Status:** Planned
    *   **Priority:** MEDIUM

*   **Task NEX-INT-01: Plan Initial Integrations**
    *   **Relates to:** Enabling future functionality.
    *   **Goal:** Identify how NEXUS analysis results could integrate with other subsystems.
    *   **Sub-Tasks:**
        *   [ ] Determine how analysis results (e.g., dependencies, complexity scores) could be stored or represented in ATLAS (Ref Task `ATL-STR-01`).
        *   [ ] Consider how NEXUS could be triggered (e.g., on code changes via CRONOS, on demand via Mycelium request).
        *   [ ] Explore how analysis results could inform CORUJA orchestration or ETHIK checks.
    *   **Status:** Planned
    *   **Priority:** LOW (for Phase 2, higher later)

---

## Future Phases (Placeholder)

*   Implement specific analysis modules (e.g., Python AST parsing for dependencies, PDD schema validation).
*   Develop APIs/services for triggering analysis and retrieving results.
*   Integrate with CI/CD pipelines.
*   Implement optimization suggestions based on analysis.
