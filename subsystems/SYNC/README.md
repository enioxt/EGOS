# SYNC Subsystem

## Role in Dynamic Roadmap Sync & EGOS Interconnection

SYNC is responsible for:
- Ensuring data integrity and consistency across all subsystems during roadmap sync and interconnection.
- Validating the integrity of roadmap sync operations and handling error states or conflicts.
- Collaborating with MYCELIUM, KOIOS, and CRONOS to guarantee that all subsystems are always in a consistent, up-to-date state.

Cross-reference: See ROADMAP.md sections "Dynamic Roadmap Sync & Mycelium Interconnection" and "Technical Implementation Plan: Dynamic Roadmap Sync (Phase 1)".

SYNC is the subsystem dedicated to synchronization and data consistency within the EGOS architecture. It works alongside Mycelium and Cronos to ensure that all distributed state and data is always correct, recoverable, and up-to-date. See the main project documentation for details.
