# üõ£Ô∏è SYNC Subsystem Roadmap (Placeholder)

**Version:** 0.1
**Last Updated:** [Current Date - Please Update Manually]

## Overview

The purpose and scope of the SYNC subsystem need clarification. It currently only contains documentation.

## Action Required

*   [ ] **Task META-SYNC-01:** Define the purpose of the SYNC subsystem. What kind of synchronization is it intended to handle? Is it related to Mycelium or a separate concept? Should its contents be merged elsewhere?

*(Based on the decision, this roadmap should be updated with concrete tasks or the directory removed/refactored.)*
