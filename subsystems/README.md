# üß© EGOS Subsystems Overview

This directory contains the core functional components of the EGOS project, organized into distinct subsystems. Each subsystem encapsulates a specific set of responsibilities, interacting with others via the Mycelium Network (conceptual communication layer).

Refer to the main project [README](../../README.md) for the overall EGOS vision and the [Master Quantum Prompt (MQP)](../../docs/MQP.md) for the guiding principles.

## Core Subsystems

Click on a subsystem name to navigate to its specific directory, which contains its source code, tests, and detailed README.

*   **[ATLAS/](ATLAS/):** Systemic Cartography & Visualization
    *   *Purpose:* Maps system components, dependencies, and relationships to provide transparency and understanding.
*   **[CORUJA/](CORUJA/):** AI Orchestration & Interaction
    *   *Purpose:* Manages interactions with AI models (LLMs), handles complex multi-step tasks (SPARC), and orchestrates AI agents.
*   **[CRONOS/](CRONOS/):** Evolutionary Preservation & State Management
    *   *Purpose:* Ensures system history integrity, manages state, handles backups, and maintains context continuity.
*   **[ETHIK/](ETHIK/):** Ethical Framework & Validation
    *   *Purpose:* Enforces ethical guidelines, validates actions, ensures data privacy and sanitization, and promotes alignment.
*   **[HARMONY/](HARMONY/):** Integration & Compatibility Layer
    *   *Purpose:* Facilitates smooth integration between different components, tools, and platforms (e.g., Windows compatibility).
*   **[KOIOS/](KOIOS/):** Standardization, Knowledge & Search
    *   *Purpose:* Enforces coding and documentation standards, manages logging, facilitates search, and maintains the knowledge base.
*   **[MYCELIUM/](MYCELIUM/):** Inter-Subsystem Communication Network
    *   *Purpose:* Defines the protocols and facilitates event-driven communication between subsystems (currently conceptual/standard-based).
*   **[NEXUS/](NEXUS/):** Modular Analysis & Optimization
    *   *Purpose:* Analyzes code structure, dependencies, and modularity; suggests refactoring and optimization opportunities.

*Each subsystem directory contains a detailed `README.md` explaining its specific role, architecture, and how to interact with it.*
