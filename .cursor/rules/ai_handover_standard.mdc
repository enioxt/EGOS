# AI Handover Standard (KOIOS Workflow)

## 1. Goal & Objective

*   **Goal:** To ensure seamless continuity and maintain full project context when development tasks are handed over between different AI assistants (e.g., Gemini to RooCode, or between human/AI collaborators).
*   **Objective:** Define a standardized format and minimum required content for handover summaries, enabling the incoming AI to quickly initialize itself and understand the current project state, recent actions, pending tasks, and relevant standards.

## 2. Context & Trigger

*   **When:** This standard applies whenever the primary AI assistant working on the EGOS project is about to change, or when a significant pause in work occurs, requiring a state summary for future resumption.
*   **Trigger:** Explicit request from the user for a handover or summary.

## 3. Handover Summary Requirements

The outgoing AI **MUST** generate a handover summary containing the following sections:

1.  **Handover Metadata:**
    *   To/From (AI/User)
    *   Date
    *   Subject (Clear purpose, e.g., "EGOS Project State & Next Steps - Handoff")
2.  **Project Overview:**
    *   Brief statement of the project (EGOS) and current high-level focus.
    *   Link to the main repository.
    *   Explicit mention of core principles (Ethics, Modularity, English-only) and links to key documents (`quantum_prompt_core.mdc`, `PHILOSOPHY.md`).
    *   Reference to KOIOS standards location (`.cursor/rules/`, `subsystems/KOIOS/docs/STANDARDS.md`).
3.  **Summary of Recent Actions:**
    *   Bulleted list of significant accomplishments since the last summary/handoff.
    *   Reference specific files created/modified.
    *   Mention the relevant Git commit hash(es) if applicable.
4.  **Current Project State:**
    *   Overview of key files/directories relevant to the current focus (e.g., website CSS structure).
    *   Confirmation of Git status (e.g., changes committed and pushed, working directory clean).
    *   Status of related deployments (e.g., GitHub Pages build triggered).
5.  **Initialization Instructions for Incoming AI:**
    *   Explicit guidance on *how* the new AI should get context.
    *   **Mandatory:** Instruct the AI to read the `.cursor/rules/` directory, highlighting critical rules (e.g., `quantum_prompt_core.mdc`, `commit_messages.mdc`, `ai_collaboration_guidelines.mdc`).
    *   Recommend reading key project documents relevant to the current tasks (e.g., PDDs, analysis reports, design docs).
6.  **Long-Term Vision Recap:**
    *   Briefly mention relevant higher-level goals or roadmap items discussed recently.
7.  **Pending Immediate Next Steps:**
    *   Clearly list the specific, actionable tasks that the incoming AI can choose from.
    *   Request user confirmation on which task to proceed with.
8.  **Standard Signature:** End with the EGOS signature (`✧༺❀༻∞ EGOS ∞༺❀༻✧`).

## 4. Example Handover Summary

Refer to the summary generated on **2025-04-09** (see conversation history or commit `cc7f7e7` context) as a canonical example of this standard in practice.

## 5. Rationale

*   **Context Preservation (CRONOS):** Ensures vital project knowledge isn't lost during transitions.
*   **Efficiency:** Allows incoming AI/collaborators to get up to speed quickly.
*   **Consistency (KOIOS):** Standardizes a crucial part of the collaborative workflow.
*   **Clarity:** Reduces ambiguity about the project's current state and next steps.
