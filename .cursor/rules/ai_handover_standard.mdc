# AI Handover Standard (KOIOS Workflow)

**Multi-Agent Context Note:** This standard is **CRITICAL** when operating in a multi-agent environment (see `.cursor/rules/multi_agent_awareness.mdc`). Accurate and complete handovers prevent context loss, duplicated effort, and conflicting actions between agents (e.g., Gemini Orchestrator and Quasar-Alpha Executor).

## 1. Goal & Objective

*   **Goal:** To ensure seamless continuity and maintain full project context when development tasks are handed over between different AI assistants (e.g., Gemini to RooCode, or between human/AI collaborators).
*   **Objective:** Define a standardized format and minimum required content for handover summaries, enabling the incoming AI to quickly initialize itself and understand the current project state, recent actions, pending tasks, and relevant standards.

## 2. Context & Trigger

*   **When:** This standard applies whenever the primary AI assistant working on the EGOS project is about to change, or when a significant pause in work occurs, requiring a state summary for future resumption.
*   **Trigger:** Explicit request from the user for a handover or summary.

## 3. Handover Summary Requirements

The outgoing AI **MUST** generate a handover summary containing the following sections:

1.  **Handover Metadata:**
    *   To/From (AI/User)
    *   Date
    *   Subject (Clear purpose, e.g., "EGOS Project State & Next Steps - Handoff")
2.  **Project Overview:**
    *   Brief statement of the project (EGOS) and current high-level focus.
    *   Link to the main repository.
    *   Explicit mention of core principles (Ethics, Modularity, English-only) and links to key documents (`quantum_prompt_core.mdc`, `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md`).
    *   Reference to KOIOS standards location (`.cursor/rules/`, `subsystems/KOIOS/docs/STANDARDS.md`).
    *   **Subsection 3.2.a: Security Considerations (Handling Sensitive Information)**
        *   State clearly that sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.) **MUST NOT** be included directly in the handover summary.
        *   Reference the standard secure mechanism for retrieving secrets within EGOS (e.g., environment variables, Vault, `.env` files).
3.  **Summary of Recent Actions:**
    *   Bulleted list of significant accomplishments since the last summary/handoff.
    *   Reference specific files created/modified.
    *   Mention the relevant Git commit hash(es) if applicable.
    *   **Include brief rationale** for significant actions (the "why").
    *   **If possible, link to related GitHub Issues, PRs, or discussions** for context.
4.  **Assumptions Made:**
    *   List any significant assumptions made during the preceding work session (e.g., API stability, schema versions, requirement finality).
5.  **Current Project State:**
    *   Overview of key files/directories relevant to the current focus.
    *   **Subsection 3.5.a: Git Status (Structured JSON Recommended)**
        *   Provide detailed Git state information within a JSON code block:
            ```json
            {
              "branch": "main",
              "commit_sha": "f27fa44",
              "is_clean": "true",
              "remote_sync_status": "ahead 1",
              "recent_log": [
                { "sha": "f27fa44", "msg": "docs(rules): add multi-agent awareness rule & update handover standard" },
                { "sha": "999a67c", "msg": "docs: integrate strategic notes & refine website plan..." },
                { "sha": "31d6407", "msg": "docs(website): update roadmap and add development plan..." }
              ]
            }
            ```
    *   **Subsection 3.5.b: CI/CD Status (Structured JSON Recommended)**
        *   Provide specific CI/CD run details for the `commit_sha` within a JSON code block:
            ```json
            {
              "pipeline_name": "N/A",
              "workflow_run_url": "N/A",
              "triggering_commit": "f27fa44",
              "conclusion": "N/A",
              "artifacts_url": "N/A",
              "logs_url": "N/A"
            }
            ```
        *   **If possible, report the actual conclusion of the latest relevant CI/CD run** (success/failure), not just a link.
    *   **Subsection 3.5.c: Environment Details (Structured YAML Recommended)**
        *   List key dependencies and configurations relevant to the current focus within a YAML code block:
            ```yaml
            dependencies:
              - service: GitHub Pages
                type: Static Hosting
                endpoint: https://enioxt.github.io/egos/docs/
                status: operational
                notes: Current deployment method. Planned to change.
            configuration_files:
              - path: docs/website/DESIGN_GUIDE.md
                notes: Core design principles.
              - path: docs/website/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
                notes: Detailed task breakdown.
              - path: docs/website/CURRENT_TASKS.md
                notes: Immediate focus.
              - path: .cursor/rules/
                notes: Contains KOIOS standards.
            data_state:
              - notes: Primarily static content and markdown plans.
            ```
6.  **Known Issues, Risks, and Technical Debt (Structured YAML Recommended)**
    *   Detail relevant issues, risks, or debt impacting the current focus or next steps within a YAML code block:
        ```yaml
        - id: RISK-UX-RESEARCH
          type: Risk
          description: Proceeding with WIA-3 (User Flows) without completing WUX Research might lead to misaligned design.
          severity: Medium
          status: Identified
          relevant_files:
            - docs/website/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
          notes: WUX Phase planned to mitigate this.
        ```
7.  **Initialization Instructions for Incoming AI:**
    *   Explicit guidance on *how* the new AI should get context.
    *   **Mandatory:** Instruct the AI to read the `.cursor/rules/` directory, highlighting critical rules (e.g., `quantum_prompt_core.mdc`, `commit_messages.mdc`, `ai_collaboration_guidelines.mdc`).
    *   Recommend reading key project documents relevant to the current tasks (e.g., PDDs, analysis reports, design docs).
    *   **Mandatory Verification:** Instruct the incoming AI to:
        1.  **Confirm understanding** by re-summarizing the 'Pending Immediate Next Steps' (Section 3.9) and stating the 'commit_sha' reported in Section 3.5.a.
        2.  **Perform context-specific diagnostic checks** suggested by the handover content (e.g., "Verify read access to file X mentioned in recent actions," "Verify connection to service Y listed in Environment Details").
    *   **Mandatory Failure Protocol:** If any mandatory verification or diagnostic check fails:
        1.  Report the specific failure clearly to the user.
        2.  Halt further task execution.
        3.  Request user guidance.
8.  **Long-Term Vision Recap:**
    *   Briefly mention relevant higher-level goals or roadmap items discussed recently.
9.  **Pending Immediate Next Steps (Structured YAML Recommended)**
    *   Clearly list the specific, actionable tasks **for the incoming agent** within a YAML code block:
        ```yaml
        - id: WUX-1
          description: Plan User Research. Define specific research questions based on goals & draft personas (see Orchestrator handover). Propose methodology (e.g., survey draft, analogous site analysis plan).
          priority: High
          assignee: Quasar-Alpha
          depends_on: null
          relevant_files:
            - docs/website/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
            - docs/ai_collaboration/MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md
          notes: Focus on defining *how* to research the 5 goals outlined.
        ```
    *   **(Orchestrator Note):** Do not list *all* future tasks, only the immediate ones for the agent receiving the handover.
10. **Standard Signature:** End with the EGOS signature (`✧༺❀༻∞ EGOS ∞༺❀༻✧`).

## 4. Example Handover Summary

*(Note: This section should be updated with an example reflecting the v1.3.0 structure, including structured data snippets and explicit examples like those added above.)*
Refer to the summary generated on **2025-04-09** (see conversation history or commit `cc7f7e7` context) as a starting point, but ensure future examples adhere to the full v1.2.0 standard.

## 5. Rationale

*   **Context Preservation (CRONOS):** Ensures vital project knowledge (state, rationale, assumptions, risks, environment) isn't lost during transitions.
*   **Efficiency:** Allows incoming AI/collaborators to initialize faster and more reliably.
*   **Consistency (KOIOS):** Standardizes a crucial part of the collaborative workflow with increased detail and structure.
*   **Clarity & Reduced Ambiguity:** Structured data and explicit sections improve understanding for all parties.
*   **Robustness:** Mandatory verification and failure protocols prevent errors from misunderstood context.
*   **Security:** Explicitly addresses handling of sensitive information.
