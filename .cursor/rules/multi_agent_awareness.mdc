# Multi-Agent Awareness Standard (KOIOS Standard)

## Rule

Guidelines for agents to discover, interact with, and adapt to the presence and capabilities of other agents via Mycelium or other mechanisms.

## Rationale

Enables dynamic collaboration, task delegation, and emergent system behavior.

## Examples

### Correct Usage

-   An agent querying Mycelium for available services before attempting a task.
-   An agent adjusting its strategy based on the reported load of other agents.

### Incorrect Usage

-   Hardcoding assumptions about other agents' availability or capabilities.
-   Ignoring messages or signals from other agents.

**Design agents to be aware of and interact effectively within the multi-agent environment.**
