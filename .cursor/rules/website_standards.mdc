# EGOS Website Development Standards

## 1. Language & Accessibility

- All content, comments, and code **must be in English** (except localized content placeholders).
- Follow accessibility best practices (semantic HTML5, ARIA labels, contrast).

## 2. Structure & Modularity

- Use **semantic HTML5** with clear sectioning (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
- Organize CSS modularly by components and pages.
- Organize JS modularly, with clear event listeners and comments.

## 3. Multilingual Support

- Use `.lang-content` divs for each language.
- Toggle visibility via JS.
- Use placeholders for untranslated content.

## 4. Styling

- Follow the design concept in `research/WebSite Enio Grok e Gemini.txt`.
- Color palette: Deep Blue `#0A2342`, Warm Orange `#FF6600`, light backgrounds.
- Typography: Inter (body), Playfair Display (headings).
- Emphasize minimalism: whitespace, clear hierarchy, limited color use.
- Responsive design: mobile-first, media queries, hamburger menu.

## 5. Interactivity

- Implement hamburger menu toggle.
- Implement expandable subsystem cards.
- Add placeholders for LLM chatbot and contextual help icons.
- Add comments for future animations, LLM integration, and advanced interactivity.

## 6. Performance

- Add TODO comments for:
  - Lazy loading images.
  - Minifying CSS/JS.
  - Async/defer script loading.
- Optimize for fast load times.

## 7. Documentation

- Document all website features and changes in `README.md` and `docs/website/WEBSITE_DESIGN.md`.
- Update roadmap with all website-related tasks and progress.

## 8. Compliance

- Follow KOIOS standards for code quality, documentation, and commit messages.
- Align with ETHIK principles (privacy, accessibility, clarity).
