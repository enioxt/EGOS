# EGOS Human-AI Collaboration Guidelines (KOIOS/CORUJA Standard)

**Primary Reference:** The core principles, mandatory procedures (including human verification), and operational guidelines for Human-AI collaboration are defined in the central EGOS rules file:

*   **`./global_rules.mdc` (Sections 6 and 8)**

Please refer to that document for authoritative standards.

This file is retained for context discovery but the primary source of truth is `global_rules.mdc`.
