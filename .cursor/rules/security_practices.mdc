# Security Practices (KOIOS Standard)

**Primary Reference:** The core principles, mandatory procedures, and standards for security and privacy in EGOS development are defined in the central EGOS rules file:

*   **`./global_rules.mdc` (Section 2, Section 6 - AI Security, Section 8 - Command Safety)**

Please refer to that document for authoritative standards, including rules on authentication, data protection, input/output handling, dependency management, secure coding, AI-specific security, and operational safety.

This file is retained for context discovery, but the primary source of truth is `global_rules.mdc`.
