# Commit Message Standards (KOIOS / Conventional Commits)

**Primary Reference:** The mandatory standard for Git commit messages (Conventional Commits) is defined in the central EGOS rules file:

*   **`./global_rules.mdc` (Section 5 - Version Control & Commits)**

Please refer to that document for the authoritative standard.

This file is retained for context discovery, but the primary source of truth is `global_rules.mdc`.
