# Commit Message Standard (KOIOS Standard)

## Rule

All Git commit messages **MUST** follow the [Conventional Commits specification v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This includes using a standard type prefix (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `perf:`, `ci:`, `build:`), an optional scope in parentheses, a concise description, an optional body for more detail, and optional footers (e.g., `BREAKING CHANGE:`, `Closes #123`).

## Rationale

Adhering to Conventional Commits provides a standardized, machine-readable format for commit history. This enables automated changelog generation, simplifies history navigation and analysis (e.g., finding features vs. fixes), triggers CI/CD processes based on commit types, and improves overall clarity and collaboration by establishing a shared language for changes.

## Examples

### Correct Usage

```
feat: add user authentication endpoint

Implement JWT-based authentication using the /login route.
Closes #123
```

```
fix(parser): handle malformed input gracefully

Previously, unexpected characters would cause a crash. Now,
an error is logged and parsing continues.
```

### Incorrect Usage

```
fixed stuff
```

```
Update code
```

**Follow the Conventional Commits specification for clear and consistent commit messages.**

**Primary Reference:** The mandatory standard for Git commit messages (Conventional Commits) is defined in the central EGOS rules file:

*   **`./global_rules.mdc` (Section 5 - Version Control & Commits)**

Please refer to that document for the authoritative standard.

This file is retained for context discovery, but the primary source of truth is `global_rules.mdc`.

* **Key Principle:** Systemic Cartography, Conscious Modularity (clear change history)
